# Elden ring backup assistant
 This progam will back up your elden ring files into a backup folder marked with the date and time (m.d.y-hms) as the name of the folder.

 ### how to properly install it
 * go to you files and navigate to %appdata%
 * then place the program files "Create_ElderRing_Backup" and "Elder_Ring_Backup_Script" in that folder "Roaming"
 * next to make it easier on your self to back up, right click and create a shortcut for "Create_ElderRing_Backup" Bat file and put it on your decktop to be able to run it without going to that folder every time.
 * from there you can run the program and it will make a backup every time you run it.

## Tips
 * The first time you run it, it will create the back up folder, and while making the folder it might not back it up on the first run. 
      * so best Practice is to run it twice when you first set it up and double check that it has made a backup and its all working! 
 * the backups folder will be called "EldenRingBackups", and it will be found in the same folder we just navigated to.
