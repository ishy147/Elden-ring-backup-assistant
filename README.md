# Elden ring backup assistant
 This progam will back up your elden ring files into a backup folder marked with the date and time (m.d.y-h:m:s) as the name of the folder.

 ### how to properly install it
 * go to you files and navigate to %appdata%
 * then place the program in that folder "Roaming"
 * next to make it easier on your self to back up, create a shortcut from the program and put it on your decktop.
 * from there you can run the program and it will make a backup every time you run it.

 * tip: the backups folder will be called "EldenRingBackups", and it will be found in the same folder we just navigated to.
